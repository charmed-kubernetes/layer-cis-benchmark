    Run the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark against snap-based components.
  params:
    apply:
      type: string
      default: 'none'
      description: |
        Apply remediations to address benchmark failures. The default, 'none',
        will not attempt to fix any reported failures. Set to 'conservative'
        to resolve simple failures. Set to 'dangerous' to attempt to resolve
        all failures.

        Note: Applying any remediation may result in an unusable cluster.
    config:
      type: string
      default: 'https://github.com/charmed-kubernetes/kube-bench-config/archive/cis-1.20.zip#sha1=138c7f5e9c10aac0aeabd14b4e1109b1dcfe3038'
      description: |
        Archive containing configuration files to use when running kube-bench.
        The default value is known to be compatible with snap components. When
        using a custom URL, append '#<hash_type>=<checksum>' to verify the
        archive integrity when downloaded.
    release:
      type: string
      default: 'https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench/releases/download/v0.6.5/kube-bench_0.6.5_linux_amd64.tar.gz#sha256=944a3d0f95518c2e02d7449af3f9114cf5d125d5b507efbf16c6cde10d4e598c'
      description: |
        Archive containing the 'kube-bench' binary to run. The default value
        points to a stable upstream release. When using a custom URL, append
        '#<hash_type>=<checksum>' to verify the archive integrity when
        downloaded.

        This may also be set to the special keyword 'upstream'. In this case,
        the action will compile and use a local kube-bench binary built from
        the master branch of the upstream repository:
